# 👋 Hello developer/spectator!
This is the README of Sem - 4. A website created to help my fellow classmates as well as myself. This website contains all the study material of 4th sem. Check out the site [Sem-4](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to grow in your life. 🦄


## 🏗 What's next?
All the new material will be added to the site within 3 days and if this gets success, I will make a new site for Sem - 5 too. 

## 🎨 Where to find everything

- **Repository:** Everything is available in our [Sem - 4](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) repository, you don't have to go anywhere.

- **Emojis:** The emojis that I used are provided by HTML itself.
